Immunoelectron microscopy showed Nup98 to be asymmetrically located at the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC.

      "The CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor activates a Gi-coupled phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. The cellular effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are mediated primarily by binding to the CXC chemokine receptor-4. We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

      "The CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor activates a Gi-coupled phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. The cellular effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are mediated primarily by binding to the CXC chemokine receptor-4. We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1.

      "The CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor activates a Gi-coupled phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. The cellular effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are mediated primarily by binding to the CXC chemokine receptor-4. We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

      "The CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor activates a Gi-coupled phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. The cellular effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are mediated primarily by binding to the CXC chemokine receptor-4. We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

      "The CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor activates a Gi-coupled phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. The cellular effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are mediated primarily by binding to the CXC chemokine receptor-4. We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

      "The CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor activates a Gi-coupled phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. The cellular effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are mediated primarily by binding to the CXC chemokine receptor-4. We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

      "The CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor activates a Gi-coupled phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. The cellular effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are mediated primarily by binding to the CXC chemokine receptor-4. We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

      "The CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor activates a Gi-coupled phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. The cellular effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are mediated primarily by binding to the CXC chemokine receptor-4. We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

      "The peptide repeat domain of nucleoporin Nup98 functions as a docking site in transport across the nuclear pore complex. We report the cDNA deduced primary structure of a wheat germ agglutinin-reactive nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein of rat. The protein, termed Nup98 (for nucleoporin of 98 kDa), contains numerous GLFG and FG repeats and some FXFG repeats and is thus a vertebrate member of a family of GLFG nucleoporins that were previously discovered in yeast. Immunoelectron microscopy showed Nup98 to be asymmetrically located at the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC. Nup98 functions as one of several docking site nucleoporins in a cytosolic docking activity-mediated binding of a model transport substrate. The docking site of Nup98 was mapped to its N-terminal half, which contains all of the peptide repeats. A recombinant segment of this region depleted the docking activity of cytosol. We suggest that the peptide repeat domain of Nup98, together with peptide repeat domains of other nucleoporins, forms an array of sites for mediated docking of transport substrate, and that bidirectional transport across the NPC proceeds by repeated docking and undocking reactions.\n",

      "The CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor activates a Gi-coupled phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. The cellular effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are mediated primarily by binding to the CXC chemokine receptor-4. We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

      "The CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor activates a Gi-coupled phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. The cellular effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are mediated primarily by binding to the CXC chemokine receptor-4. We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1.

      "The CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor activates a Gi-coupled phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. The cellular effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are mediated primarily by binding to the CXC chemokine receptor-4. We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

We report the cDNA deduced primary structure of a wheat germ agglutinin-reactive nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein of rat. The protein, termed Nup98 (for nucleoporin of 98 kDa), contains numerous GLFG and FG repeats and some FXFG repeats and is thus a vertebrate member of a family of GLFG nucleoporins that were previously discovered in yeast. Immunoelectron microscopy showed Nup98 to be asymmetrically located at the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC. Nup98 functions as one of several docking site nucleoporins in a cytosolic docking activity-mediated binding of a model transport substrate. The docking site of Nup98 was mapped to its N-terminal half, which contains all of the peptide repeats. A recombinant segment of this region depleted the docking activity of cytosol. We suggest that the peptide repeat domain of Nup98, together with peptide repeat domains of other nucleoporins, forms an array of sites for mediated docking of transport substrate, and that bidirectional transport across the NPC proceeds by repeated docking and undocking reactions.\n",

The cellular effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are mediated primarily by binding to the CXC chemokine receptor-4. We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1.

We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

      "The peptide repeat domain of nucleoporin Nup98 functions as a docking site in transport across the nuclear pore complex. We report the cDNA deduced primary structure of a wheat germ agglutinin-reactive nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein of rat. The protein, termed Nup98 (for nucleoporin of 98 kDa), contains numerous GLFG and FG repeats and some FXFG repeats and is thus a vertebrate member of a family of GLFG nucleoporins that were previously discovered in yeast. Immunoelectron microscopy showed Nup98 to be asymmetrically located at the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC. Nup98 functions as one of several docking site nucleoporins in a cytosolic docking activity-mediated binding of a model transport substrate. The docking site of Nup98 was mapped to its N-terminal half, which contains all of the peptide repeats. A recombinant segment of this region depleted the docking activity of cytosol. We suggest that the peptide repeat domain of Nup98, together with peptide repeat domains of other nucleoporins, forms an array of sites for mediated docking of transport substrate, and that bidirectional transport across the NPC proceeds by repeated docking and undocking reactions.\n",

      "The CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor activates a Gi-coupled phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. The cellular effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are mediated primarily by binding to the CXC chemokine receptor-4. We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

      "The CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor activates a Gi-coupled phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. The cellular effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are mediated primarily by binding to the CXC chemokine receptor-4. We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1.

The cellular effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are mediated primarily by binding to the CXC chemokine receptor-4. We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

      "The CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor activates a Gi-coupled phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. The cellular effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are mediated primarily by binding to the CXC chemokine receptor-4. We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

We report in this study that SDF-1 and its peptide analogues induce a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in Jurkat cells. This SDF-1-stimulated generation of D-3 phosphoinositide lipids was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an SDF-1 peptide antagonist or an anti-CXCR4 Ab. In addition, the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, as well as the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, also inhibited the SDF-1-stimulated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The effects of SDF-1 on D-3 phosphoinositide lipid accumulation correlated well with activation of the known PI 3-kinase effector protein kinase B, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and pertussis toxin. Concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, sufficient to inhibit PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, also inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes in response to SDF-1. In contrast, SDF-1-stimulated actin polymerization was only partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that while chemotaxis is fully dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, actin polymerization requires additional biochemical inputs. Finally, SDF-1-stimulated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 partially attenuated chemotaxis in response to SDF-1. Hence, it appears that ERK1/2 activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and both biochemical events are involved in the regulation of SDF-1-stimulated chemotaxis.\n",

      "The peptide repeat domain of nucleoporin Nup98 functions as a docking site in transport across the nuclear pore complex. We report the cDNA deduced primary structure of a wheat germ agglutinin-reactive nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein of rat. The protein, termed Nup98 (for nucleoporin of 98 kDa), contains numerous GLFG and FG repeats and some FXFG repeats and is thus a vertebrate member of a family of GLFG nucleoporins that were previously discovered in yeast. Immunoelectron microscopy showed Nup98 to be asymmetrically located at the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC. Nup98 functions as one of several docking site nucleoporins in a cytosolic docking activity-mediated binding of a model transport substrate. The docking site of Nup98 was mapped to its N-terminal half, which contains all of the peptide repeats. A recombinant segment of this region depleted the docking activity of cytosol. We suggest that the peptide repeat domain of Nup98, together with peptide repeat domains of other nucleoporins, forms an array of sites for mediated docking of transport substrate, and that bidirectional transport across the NPC proceeds by repeated docking and undocking reactions.\n",
